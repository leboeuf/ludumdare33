## Description

Kraken vs Leviathan - Action party game, local multiplayer with AIs available, playable up to 4 players!

Krakens and Leviathans are having a fierce competition to see who are the top monsters!! Unfortunately, this lost submarine has been caught in the middle of the fight and is being used as their playing ball. 

Kraken vs Leviathan is a competitive local multiplayer game where players try to shoot the ball into the opponent's net while polluting the water as much as possible. Monsters move faster in their own pollution and teamwork is the key to prove that you are the better monster.
